        <p>We have created some projects and they are very simple as butter</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Colour Flipper</li><br>
            <ul>
                <li>In this article, we are going to build a simple color flipper which will change the background to a random color, on the click of a button.</li>
                <li>We are going to do this project in codepen. So, open any codepen and put this basic html and css. In the html, we have a container class wrapping a h2 and button.</li>
                <li>In the CSS, we are placing the main at the center. Also, adding basic styles for h2 and color.</li>

        </ul><br>
        <li>Counter</li><br>
        <ul>
            <li>In this John Smilga tutorial, you will learn how to create a counter and you guys can also write conditions that change the color based on positive or negative numbers displayed.</li>
            <li>This project will give you more practice working with the DOM and you can use this simple counter in other projects like a pomodoro clock.</li><br>

        <li>How to create a Review carousel</li><br>
        <ul>
            <li>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a carousel of reviews with a button that generates random reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a good feature to have on an ecommerce site to display customer reviews or a personal portfolio to display client reviews.</li>

        <li>Create a game with JavaScript</li><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you wanted to build something fun and simple to practice your Front End skills but the thought of building another TODO application makes you want to quit this wonderful path you’ve started on?</li>
            <li>Well look no further, today we’ll be building a simple (drumroll) Tic Tac Toe game. We’ll cover some basics like using CSS grid, query selectors and structuring our game flow and logic.</li><br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We have discussed 4 out of the ocean of JS projects. However, these 4 projects can add much value to your portfolio and cover almost all the important concepts you need to know about JavaScript. If you want to learn more about JS, stay tuned because we will be updating our sites every day. Most of the time, you don’t need any frameworks to write JS code and no editors or IDEs. You can write on a Textpad or Wordpad and save your file with a .html extension. JS files are stored with the .js extension, but you can include all the JS in the HTML file itself (though not advisable for a big project).</p>
